# jQuery Visualize Stack

This plugin apply various shades of a color to elements stacked with z-index in order of their z-index level.  Useful if you have multiple
widgets/elements stacked on top of each other and need to quickly visualize their stack positions.

At the moment this plugin only works on browsers that support CSS3 hsl() styling.  Sorry, IE.
